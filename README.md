# Student-List
Python program which takes in Name and Student ID info, saves it to a .txt file, then outputs the contents of the file.
Uses several functions, includes data validation, auto-capitalization of first letters of first and last name,  and exception handling.
Saves input to a file called "students.txt" in the same directory as the program. If this file does not exist, it will be created
automatically. Also uses a while loop so users can enter as many students as they want. students.txt will persist, so more students 
can be added later by running the program again.
